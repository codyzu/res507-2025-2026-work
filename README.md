## Source of truth

👉 **The course website is the authoritative source for all lab instructions.**

This repository does not duplicate lab steps or explanations.
If something in this repo seems unclear, follow the instructions on the course site.

## How this repository is used

- Each lab has its own folder under `labs/`
- You will create, modify, and delete files as part of the labs
- Making mistakes is expected and part of the learning process

You do not need to “protect” this repository.

## Folder overview

- `labs/`  
  Contains one folder per lab. Each folder includes a short README for orientation only.

## If something goes wrong

If you get stuck or your repository is in a bad state:

3. Clone it again from the original URL

Starting fresh is always acceptable in this course.
